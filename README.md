# Object Oriented Systems Development I

Problem:
Implement an object-oriented system in python for simulating a Gamer Library (Biblioteca Gamer).

Scope of development:
Creation of a system that simulates a Gamer library. Each game has a genre, name, year of
release, number of hours played by the user, purchase price, number of trophies
that can be unlocked, amount of trophies the user has accumulated in the game, whether it's multiplayer or
not and if it has already been fully played by the user. Each library user must have a name, email and user ID and trophies accumulated per game. User ID cannot be repeated. The system should allow:
- Users's registration and exclusion;
- Games's registration and exclusion;
- Addition of game acquisition per user;
- Conducting user research;
- Conducting game research;

Consider the following rules:
- The games will already be loaded in memory when starting the program;
- Some users will also come loaded on the system with some games associated with them;
- It is not necessary to check user balance when purchasing new games;
Scope restrictions:
The system should only include the main functions of a Gamer Library in order to maintain the
simplicity and cohesion in the design.
